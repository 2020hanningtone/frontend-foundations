    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>This site is built with HTML and CSS.</p>

    <h2>Starting with HTML</h2>
    <p>Everything begins with HTML. I learned how to structure pages using headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images. This foundation made building webpages clear and fun.</p>
    <hr>
    
     <h3>Creating My First Page</h3>
    <p>I made a simple personal profile page with my name, bio, and a picture. It felt amazing to see my code come alive in the browser.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Moving on to CSS</h2>
    <p>After HTML, I learned CSS to style my pages. I discovered colors, fonts, margins, padding, flexbox, and grid layouts.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Styling My Profile Page</h3>
    <p>I added background colors, styled my headings, and made my page responsive. Seeing a beautiful design emerge from plain HTML was very satisfying.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Learning JavaScript</h2>
    <p>With HTML and CSS ready, I started JavaScript. I learned variables, functions, loops, and DOM manipulation.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Adding Interactivity</h3>
    <p>I made buttons that changed colors and displayed alerts. I realized JavaScript could make websites alive!</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Finally, React</h2>
    <p>React allowed me to combine everything I learned. Components, props, state, and hooks became my new tools for building dynamic web applications.</p>


    <p title="I'm a tooltip">HTML images are defined with the img tag, and the filename of the image source is specified in the src attribute:</p>

    <img src="images/blessed.jpg" alt="Blessed image" width="220" height="277"a>

    <p style="color: blue;">The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks:</p>
    <pre style="font-size: 120%;">
   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

   My Bonnie lies over the sea.

   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
   
   Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
    </pre>

    <h2>Link to an Email Address</h2>

<p>To create a link that opens in the user's email program (to let them send a new email), use mailto: inside the href attribute:</p>
<p><a href="mailto:jameshanningotne954@gmail.com">Send mail</a></p>
